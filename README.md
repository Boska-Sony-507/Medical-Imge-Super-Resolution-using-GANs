# Medical-Imge-Super-Resolution-using-GANs

This project implements **Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN)** to enhance the resolution of medical images, specifically MRI brain scans.  
The goal is to reconstruct **high-resolution images** from low-resolution inputs, preserving fine details that are crucial for diagnosis.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses **SRGAN** for realistic super-resolution.
- Works with medical datasets (MRI brain scans).
- Supports **PSNR** and **SSIM** evaluation metrics.
- Colab-compatible for quick training and inference.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Dataset used: **MRI Brain Images** (paired low-resolution and high-resolution images).
- If you wish to replicate the results, download the dataset from:  
  Kaggle - MRI Dataset
